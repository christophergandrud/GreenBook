# Data Description

#### Christopher Gandrud and Cassandra Grafstrom

The data set *GB_FRED_cpi_2007.csv* was used for all analyses in the paper ''Inflated Expectations: How
government partisanship shapes monetary policy bureaucratsâ€™ inflation forecasts''.

The table below gives a brief description of each variable and its source.
Please see the paper's text for detailed descriptions of transformations
that were made to the variables.

The data set was amalgamated and variable transformations were made using source code available at: <https://github.com/christophergandrud/GreenBook/tree/master/Data/DataCreation>.
