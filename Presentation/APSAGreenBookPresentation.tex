    {\LARGE{Why should we care about presidential partisan inflation forecast bias?}} \\[0.5cm]
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Clark \& Arel-Bundock (2011) find policymakers at Federal Reserve are not politically indifferent.
            \item<2-> Could be information they receive is biased.
		\item<3-> Economists have not considered political preferences in evaluating Fed accuracy.
        \end{itemize}

  Our {\bf{dependent variable}}: \\[0.5cm]
\[
    E_{q} = \frac{F_{q} - I_{q}}{I_{q}}
\]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> $F_{q} = $ Green Book inflation forecast for quarter $q$. (We use forecasts made {\emph{two quarters}} prior).
    \item<3-> $I_{q} = $ actual inflation in quarter $q$.
    \item<4-> $E_{q} = $ the standardized inflation forecast error for quarter $q$.
  \end{itemize}

        \end{center}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Traditional understanding of Fed forecasting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Forecasts produced for every FOMC meeting
	\item<2-> Over long run no bias (e.g., Romer and Romer 2000).
	\item<3-> Periods of over- and under-estimations (Capistr\'{a}n 2008).
	\item<4-> No research on partisan influence of forecast errors.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
	\frametitle{Explaining the Pattern}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<1-> Partisan Preferences
			\item<2-> Monetary Expectations
			\item<3-> Partisan Heuristics
				\begin{itemize}
					\item<1-> Staffers expect Democrats (Republicans) to be more (less) inflationary $\rightarrow$ higher (lower) inflationary expectations
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

      {\LARGE{Followed Ho et al. (2010) to isolate the relationship between presidential partisanship/elections and the other controls.}} \\[0.5cm]
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item<2-> Created two data sets {\bf{matched}} based on:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> {\emph{presidential party ID}}
            \item<2-> {\emph{election period}}
        \end{itemize}
      \item<3-> Used the these in numerous {\bf{parametric models}} with standardized inflation forecast errors as the continuous dependent variable. 
    \end{enumerate}

    \frametitle{Conclusions}
    {\LARGE{Does presidential partisanship affect Fed staff inflation forecasts? \\[1cm]
        \begin{center}
            Probably.
        \end{center}
        }
    }
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  {\LARGE{How?}} \\[0.5cm]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Fed staff {\bf{don't}} seem to have an election-based bias. 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<2-> They don't seem to be trying to influence election outcomes or compensate for FOMC actions.
        \end{itemize}
         \\[0.3cm]
    \item<3-> Fed staff {\bf{do}} appear to have a {\bf{partisan heuristic}} that leads to a {\bf{systematic bias}} in their inflation forecasts across presidential terms.
  \end{itemize}
}

\frame{
  \frametitle{Conclusions}
  {\LARGE{Possible political implications?}} \\[0.5cm]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Overly high inflation forecasts during {\bf{Democratic}} presidencies could cause the FOMC to set interest rates {\bf{`too high'}}. This could hurt Democrats' re-election chances.
    \item<2-> Overly low forecasts during {\bf{Republican}} presidencies could cause the FOMC to set interest rates {\bf{`too low'}}. This could help Republicans' re-election chances. \\[0.3cm]
    \item<3-> But of course, {\bf{more research is needed}}.
  \end{itemize}
