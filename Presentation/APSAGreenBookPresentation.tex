    \frametitle{Motivation}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item<1-> Clark \& Arel-Bundock (2011) find policymakers at Federal Reserve are not politically indifferent.
            \item<2-> Could be information they receive is biased.
		\item<3-> Economists have not considered political preferences in evaluating Fed accuracy.
        \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{Forecast Errors}
  Our {\bf{dependent variable}}: \\[0.5cm]
\[
    E_{q} = \frac{F_{q} - I_{q}}{I_{q}}
\]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<2-> $F_{q} = $ inflation forecast for quarter $q$. (We use forecasts made {\emph{two quarters}} prior).
    \item<3-> $I_{q} = $ actual inflation in quarter $q$.
    \item<4-> $E_{q} = $ the standardized inflation forecast error for quarter $q$.
  \end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% What might explain forecast errors? %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{What Might Explain Forecast Errors?}
\frame{
  \frametitle{Traditional understanding of Fed forecasting}
\begin{itemize}
	\item<1-> Forecasts produced for every FOMC meeting
	\item<2-> Over long run no bias (e.g., Romer and Romer 2000).
	\item<3-> Periods of over- and under-estimations (Capistr\'{a}n 2008).
	\item<4-> No research on partisan influence of forecast errors.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame{
	\frametitle{Explaining the Pattern}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item<1-> Partisan Preferences
			\item<2-> Monetary Expectations
			\item<3-> Partisan Heuristics
				\begin{itemize}
					\item<1-> Staffers expect Democrats (Republicans) to be more (less) inflationary $\rightarrow$ higher (lower) inflationary expectations
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Empirical Tests %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\section{Empirical Tests}

  \frametitle{Empirical Analysis Overview}

      {\LARGE{Followed Ho et al. (2010) to issolate the relationship between presidential partisanship/elections and the other controls.}} \\[0.5cm]
    \end{center}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item<2-> Created {\bf{matched}} data sets. 
        One where {\emph{presidential party ID}} was the `treatment'
        Another where {\emph{election period}} was the `treatment
      \item<3-> Used the matched data sets in numerous {\bf{parametric models}} with standardized inflation forecast errors as the continuous dependent variable. 
    \end{enumerate}

  {\LARGE{How?}} \\[0.5cm]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item<1-> Fed staff appear to have a {\bf{partisan heuristic}} that leads to a {\bf{systematic bias}} in their inflation forecasts.
