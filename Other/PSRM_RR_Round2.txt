Dear Vera

Thank you for the opportunity to revise our manuscript ''Inflated Expectations: How government partisanship shapes monetary policy bureaucrats' inflation forecasts''. We've made the changes suggested by the reviews and discuss these in more detail below. 



Please let us know 

Best wishes,
Christopher and Cassie

## Reviewer 1

We added the additional estimation models suggested by Reviewer 1 to the Supplementary Materials as well as incorportated the results in to the discussion. In particular we added variables for:

- Percentage of the Federal Reserve Board appointed by a Democratic president.

- Number of armed conflicts that the United States participated in per year.

- Interactions between the shock variables and presidential partisan ID.

In general, these additions did not substantively change the estimated presidential partisan ID effect. 

We did estimate that the number of armed conflicts that the United States participated in is negatively associated with inflation forecasting errors. This is likely a 'War on Terror' correlation as the 2000s were both a time of many conflicts and inflation under-estimation

Some of the interactions were statistically significant (partisan )
